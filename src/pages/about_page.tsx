      <h1>Welcomasdfamy website!</h1>
      <p>Thank you for visiting. Please take a look around and let me know if you have any questions.</p>


      <h1 ></h1>
      <p >There are problems in the world which communities are solving in their own way.
        
        The focus of Ark4 is building a sustainable future for our future generations through self-sustaining descentralized economies.
        
        You may ask what about the planet, are we doing our bit? Are we a green company? Yes. <br />Is it our main focus? No.<br /><br />We are a green company in that we utilize renewable resources and our output is sustainable.<br /><br />Ark4 originates in Southern Africa, where the ever increasing power shortage is br /inging economies to their knees. The escalating cost of living and worries over energy sources, though, is a global problem!<br /><br />So in a world so reliant on energy, how do we take back our voice, our control?<br />You own the power! It is the key to economic freedom!<br />This is where the blockchain comes in and where the Dao comes into play. Everyone has a voice, a vote, a meaningful say with full transparency.

We start, we build and we collaborate with like minded organisations. Organisations aligned to the voice of their communities.<br /><br />Some might view this as a tall objective, perhaps a mountain. Even Everest was conquered, but not in a day. <br />We start small. We start one volt at a time.<br /><br />We grow. We do it together.<br /><br />We are taking action. <br />Are you?<br /></p>
